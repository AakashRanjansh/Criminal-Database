# Criminal-Database
‘Criminal Database’ Basically Stores the Criminal Records and we can Search the Criminal Record of any Criminal with any kind of data Like First Name, Convicts Code, Eye colour, Hair Colour, Date of Arrest, FIR Number etc. As we are all are familiar About the Physical Criminal Records Which are Stored in paper only. The project Can made Easy to Input Crime Records, Delete, Update Records and Search by any Data. It is helpful for The Crime Bureau administrator. Realizing the truth, I got the idea from small Rural Area Police Station where are still doing paperwork in their Police station. The main motto of this project is to end the paper working and helping us to manage the criminal record history. I have done this project with an easy solution that we can easily feed the information of criminal and search by any data/clue that we have like First Name, Convicts Code, Eye colour, Hair Colour, Date of Arrest, FIR Number etc. This project will be helpful for the Crime Bureau administrator as well as Police department to manage and Search records Easily.
